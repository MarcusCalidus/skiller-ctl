skiller-ctl
===========

The common and the multimedia keys of 
[Sharkoon Skiller keyboards](https://www.sharkoon.com/product/1693/SkillerProPlus)
work out of the box on Linux systems. With this tool, you can control the additional
features like the changeable background LED color and brightness from your PC.

Please note, as this tool is based on [libusb](http://www.libusb.org), the keyboard
is disconnected for a short time from the input handler of the kernel. Hence,
you might loose key presses while settings are changed. To avoid this problem,
this code has to be moved into the kernel.

To create this tool, the communication between the Windows driver and the device
has been eavesdropped using `usbmon` and `wireshark` (as described in
[this guide](http://kicherer.org/joomla/index.php/de/blog/38-reverse-engineering-a-usb-sound-card-with-midi-interface-for-linux)).
